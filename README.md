# deepmapdraw_tile_maker

This project assumes you installed your own DeepMapDraw instance and retrieved some data in your DeepMapDraw database.
Once configured and ran, the "main" file allow to create a dataset composed of images of tiles made from the drawings. It also creates their corresponding masks, and shapefiles that allow to control your data in a GIS.
